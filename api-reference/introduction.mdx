### Authentication

To access the typeauth API endpoints, you must include a Bearer authorization token in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests. This token is used to authenticate and authorize your API calls.
You can find your Bearer token by following these steps:

Log in to your typeauth account at https://app.typeauth.com.
Navigate to the Account section.
Locate the API Tokens tab.
Copy the provided Bearer token.

Here's an example of how to include the Bearer token in your API request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN` with the actual token you obtained from your typeauth account.

### Request Format

When making requests to the typeauth API, it is mandatory to include the `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json`. This header indicates that the request body is in JSON format.
Here's an example of how to set the Content-Type header in your API request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
```

Make sure to include this header in all your API requests to ensure proper communication with the typeauth API.

<Note>
  Please note that all API endpoints require Bearer authentication, except for
  the authentication endpoint. The authentication endpoint is used
  to validate the key/tokens and does not require prior authentication.
