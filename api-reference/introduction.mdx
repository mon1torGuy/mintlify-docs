### Authentication

To access theTypeAuthAPI endpoints, you must include a Bearer authorization token in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests. This token is used to authenticate and authorize your API calls.
You can find your Bearer token by following these steps:

Log in to yourTypeAuthaccount at https://app.typeauth.com.
Navigate to the Account section.
Locate the API Tokens tab.
Copy the provided Bearer token.

Here's an example of how to include the Bearer token in your API request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN` with the actual token you obtained from yourTypeAuthaccount.

### Request Format

When making requests to theTypeAuthAPI, it is mandatory to include the `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json`. This header indicates that the request body is in JSON format.
Here's an example of how to set the Content-Type header in your API request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
```

Make sure to include this header in all your API requests to ensure proper communication with theTypeAuthAPI.

<Note>
  Please note that all API endpoints require Bearer authentication, except for
  the authentication endpoint. The authentication endpoint is used
  to validate the key/tokens and does not require prior authentication.
