description: "Keep your API healthy with TypeAuth's monitoring system. Track uptime, response times, and receive alerts about potential issues in real-time."
---

TypeAuth automatically monitors your API endpoints to ensure high availability and reliability. Every application configured in TypeAuth includes HTTP monitoring that continuously checks your origin API's health status.

## Overview

When you configure an application, TypeAuth automatically:
- Creates a health check monitor
- Performs regular HTTP requests
- Expects 200 OK responses
- Alerts on failures

## Health Check Configuration

### Default Settings

Every application comes with a basic health check:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "url": "/",
  "method": "GET",
  "status_code": 200
}
```

## Monitoring Features

### Health Checks
- Regular HTTP requests to your API
- Custom endpoints support
- Header customization
- Response validation


## Dashboard View

Monitor your API health through the TypeAuth dashboard:
- Real-time status
- Historical uptime
- Response time graphs
- Alert history
- Incident timelines

## API Endpoints

### Get Monitor Status
```http
GET /api/v1/applications/{application_id}/monitor/status
```

### Update Monitor Configuration
```http
PUT /api/v1/applications/{application_id}/monitor
{
  "endpoint": "/healthz",
  "interval": 45,
  "timeout": 4
}
```

### Get Historical Data
```http
GET /api/v1/applications/{application_id}/monitor/history
{
  "start_date": "2024-03-14T00:00:00Z",
  "end_date": "2024-03-15T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Health Check Endpoints**
   - Create dedicated health check endpoint
   - Keep health checks lightweight
   - Include critical dependency checks
   - Return appropriate status codes

2. **Monitoring Configuration**
   - Set appropriate check intervals
   - Configure reasonable timeouts
   - Add relevant custom headers
   - Document expected responses

3. **Alert Management**
   - Configure relevant notification channels
   - Set appropriate thresholds
   - Document incident response procedures
   - Regular alert review



## Metrics Available

- **Uptime Percentage**
- **Response Times**
  - Average
  - Maximum
  - Minimum
  - Percentiles (p95, p99)
- **Status Codes**
- **SSL Certificate Validity**
- **DNS Resolution Time**

## Limitations

- Minimum check interval: 30 seconds
- Maximum check interval: 300 seconds
- Maximum custom headers: 10
- Historical data retention: 30 days
- Maximum endpoints per application: 5

## Status Codes

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| HEALTHY | All checks passing |
| DEGRADED | Some checks failing |
| DOWN | All checks failing |
| MAINTENANCE | Monitoring paused |
