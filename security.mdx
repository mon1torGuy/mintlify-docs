TypeAuth provides robust security features to protect your applications from various threats. Our security suite includes a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Geoblocking capabilities, helping you maintain a strong security posture.

## Web Application Firewall (WAF)

TypeAuth's WAF provides protection against common web vulnerabilities and attacks through a comprehensive rule set.

### Overview

The WAF includes:
- OWASP Core Rule Set integration
- TypeAuth managed security rules
- Real-time threat detection and blocking
- Low false-positive rate

### Key Protections

Our WAF protects against:
- SQL Injection attacks
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Remote Code Execution
- Local File Inclusion
- Remote File Inclusion
- HTTP Protocol Violations
- Common Web Attacks

### Configuration

#### Via Dashboard
1. Navigate to Security
2. Select "Application Security"
3. Toggle WAF status (Enable/Disable)

#### [Via API](https://docs.typeauth.com/api-reference/security)
```http
PATCH /{account_id}/security/waf/{application_id}?status=enable
```

### OWASP Rules

TypeAuth implements the OWASP Core Rule Set, which provides:
- Protocol violation checks
- Request limits
- HTTP policy enforcement
- Bad robots detection
- Security scanner detection

## Geoblocking

Control access to your applications based on geographic regions.

### Available Regions

TypeAuth offers predefined region configurations:
- üåé US (United States)
- üá™üá∫ EU (European Union)
- üáÆüá≥ IN (India)
- üåê US and EU combined
- ü¶ò AU (Australia)
- üá©üá™ GE (Germany)

### Configuration

#### Via Dashboard
1. Navigate to Application Settings
2. Select "Geoblocking"
3. Choose allowed regions
4. Save configuration

#### [Via API](https://docs.typeauth.com/api-reference/security)
```http
PATCH /{account_id}/security/geoblock/{application_id}?area=US

```

### Behavior

- Only traffic from selected regions will be allowed
- All other traffic will be blocked with a 403 Forbidden response
- IP geolocation is performed at the edge for minimal latency

## Security Best Practices

### 1. WAF Implementation

‚úÖ **Always Keep WAF Enabled**
- The WAF is your first line of defense
- Protects against known vulnerabilities
- Regular updates with new security rules

‚ùå **Risks of Disabled WAF**
- Exposure to common attack vectors
- Increased vulnerability to zero-day exploits
- No protection against automated attacks

### 2. Geoblocking Strategy

Consider these factors when configuring geoblocking:
- Your user base location
- Compliance requirements
- Business operations regions
- Known threat origins

### 3. Monitoring and Alerts

Monitor security events through:
- TypeAuth Dashboard
- Security logs
- Real-time alerts
- Traffic analytics

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Basic Security Setup

```http
POST /api/v1/applications/{application_id}/security/basic
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "waf_enabled": true,
  "geoblocking": {
    "enabled": true,
    "allowed_regions": ["US", "EU"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Advanced Configuration

```http
POST /api/v1/applications/{application_id}/security/advanced
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "waf": {
    "enabled": true,
    "sensitivity": "high",
    "custom_rules_enabled": true
  },
  "geoblocking": {
    "enabled": true,
    "allowed_regions": ["US", "EU"],
    "block_anonymous_proxy": true
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Logs

### Security Events
- Real-time security incident logging
- Detailed attack information
- Geographic origin of threats
- Attack type classification

### Access Logs
- Blocked request details
- Geolocation information
- WAF rule triggers
- Request metadata

## Response Codes

| Code | Description | Cause |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 403  | Forbidden | Geoblocking or WAF rule triggered |
| 400  | Bad Request | Invalid request format |
| 429  | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded |

## Recommendations

1. **Always-On Security**
   - Keep WAF enabled
   - Configure appropriate geoblocking
   - Monitor security events

2. **Regular Reviews**
   - Check security logs
   - Review blocked traffic
   - Update regional restrictions

3. **Incident Response**
   - Monitor security alerts
   - Document security events
   - Update security policies

## Limitations

- Maximum of 10 custom WAF rules per application
- Geoblocking limited to predefined regions
- WAF rule updates may take up to 5 minutes to propagate

## Future Security Features

We are continuously working to enhance our security features. Upcoming additions will include:
- Custom WAF rules
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection
- Advanced threat analytics
