TypeAuth provides secure opaque tokens for API authentication. These tokens serve as access credentials for your users and customers, inheriting all security configurations from their associated authentication profiles.

## Token Characteristics

- **Length**: Configurable from 32 to 128 characters
- **Format**: Opaque, cryptographically secure strings
- **Prefix**: Customizable prefix for easy identification (Up to 6 characters)
- **Tags**: Up to 3 tags per token for organization and tracking

### Token Format Example
```
ta_prod_a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

## Creating Tokens

Tokens can be generated individually or in bulk through both the dashboard and API.

### Via Dashboard
1. Navigate to Application section
2. Click "Create New Token"
3. Select the amount of tokens to generate
    -   Up to 12 through the dashboard
    -   Up to 100 over the API
4. Apply tags (optional)
5. Generate tokens

### [Via API](https://docs.typeauth.com/api-reference/keys/create-new-tokens)

#### Single Token Creation
```http
POST {account_id}/keys/create/{application_id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 64,
  "tags": [
    "customer",
    "environment"
  ]
}
```



## Token Properties

Tokens inherit properties from their associated authentication profile:

### Inherited Settings
- Rate limits
- Token expiration
- Rate limit refill periods
- Usage quotas
- Access restrictions

## Security Best Practices

1. **Token Length**
   - Use minimum 64 characters for production
   - Longer tokens for higher security requirements

2. **Token Distribution**
   - Secure transmission to end users
   - One token per client/use-case
   - Regular token rotation

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track token usage patterns
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Regular audit of active tokens

4. **Tag Management**
   - Use consistent tagging schemes
   - Include purpose and environment tags
   - Regular tag cleanup



## Limitations

- Maximum 3 tags per token
- Token length: 32-128 characters
- Maximum 100 tokens per bulk creation
- Tag value maximum length: 100 characters
