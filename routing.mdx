TypeAuth's routing system provides flexible URL transformation and request forwarding capabilities. It allows you to define how incoming requests are modified before being forwarded to your origin servers.

## Default Routing

When an application doesn't have a specific routing profile configured, TypeAuth uses default routing behavior:

### Default Behavior

- All path components, query parameters, and headers are preserved
- Requests are forwarded to the configured origin by appending the incoming path

Example:
```
Incoming request: www.enter.com/test?param=value
Origin configured: www.origin.com
Final destination: www.origin.com/test?param=value
```

## Routing Profiles

Routing profiles allow you to customize how requests are transformed before forwarding.

### Creating a Routing Profile

#### Via Dashboard
1. Navigate to Applications
2. Select your application
3. Click "Routing Profiles"
4. Create a new profile

#### [Via API](https://docs.typeauth.com/api-reference/routing/create-a-new-routing-profile)
```http
POST /{account_id}/routing/{application_id}/routing-profiles
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "<string>",
  "endpoints": [
    {
      "public_method": "<string>",
      "public_path": "<string>",
      "public_headers": [
        "<string>"
      ],
      "typeauth_response": "<string>",
      "typeauth_response_code": 123,
      "typeauth_response_body": "<string>",
      "typeauth_response_content_type": "<string>",
      "target_path": "<string>",
      "target_hostname": "<string>",
      "target_method": "<string>"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Path Variables

You can define dynamic path segments using variables in curly braces `{variable_name}`.

### Variable Usage

- Variables are defined using the format: `{variable_name}`
- Variables can be used in both source and target paths
- Values are automatically extracted and replaced

Examples:

```
Source path: /api/{version}/users/{user_id}
Target path: /{version}/users/{user_id}/details

Incoming request: /{account_id}/users/123
Transformed to: /v1/users/123/details
```

### Supported Variable Locations

Variables can be used in:
- Path segments
- Query parameters
- Headers
- Host names

## Query String Handling

### Default Behavior
- Query parameters are preserved by default
- Parameters order is maintained


## Advanced Routing Features

### Method-Based Routing

Define different rules based on HTTP methods:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "source_path": "/resources/{id}",
      "target_path": "/{account_id}/resources/{id}",
      "methods": ["GET", "HEAD"]
    },
    {
      "source_path": "/resources/{id}",
      "target_path": "/api/v2/resources/{id}",
      "methods": ["POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
    }
  ]
}
```


## Rule Priority

When multiple rules match a request:
1. More specific paths take precedence
2. Method-specific rules override generic rules
3. Later rules in the configuration override earlier ones

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic routing before adding complexity
2. **Use Meaningful Variables**: Choose descriptive names for path variables
3. **Document Transformations**: Keep track of your routing rules
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify routing behavior with different request patterns
5. **Monitor Changes**: Keep track of routing profile modifications

## Examples

### Basic Path Transformation
```json
{
  "source_path": "/api/users",
  "target_path": "/v1/users"
}
```

### Variable Usage
```json
{
  "source_path": "/api/{version}/products/{id}",
  "target_path": "/internal/products/{version}/{id}"
}
```

## Limitations

- Maximum of 50 rules per routing profile
- Maximum of 10 variables per rule
- Variable names must be alphanumeric
- Path maximum length: 2048 characters
