title: Schema Validation
description: Secure your API endpoints with TypeAuth's powerful schema validation. Configure method checks, path validation, and payload verification through an intuitive dashboard interface.

TypeAuth provides comprehensive request validation capabilities that help you ensure all incoming requests match your API specifications. Our validation system lets you configure rules through the dashboard without writing code, making API security accessible to everyone.

## Getting Started

Schema validation comes enabled by default with basic HTTP validations:

- HTTP method verification
- URL path format checking
- Content-Length validation
- Header format verification

To customize your validation rules:

1. Navigate to Schema Validation in the Dashboard
2. Click "+ New Schema Validation" in the top
3. Give a name to the configuration
4. Select the default rule `block` or `log`
5. Upload the OpenAPIv3 schema
6. Select which endpoint you want to protect.
7. Click create.

## Core Features

### Method Validation

Control which HTTP methods are allowed on your endpoints:

- Restrict to specific methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
- Configure different methods per path
- Set custom error messages
- Override defaults per endpoint

### Path Validation

Ensure URLs match your expected patterns:

- Validate path parameter presence
- Type checking for path variables
- Pattern matching with regex
- Length restrictions
- Required vs optional segments

### Variable Validation

For path, query, and header variables:

- Type validation (string, number, boolean)
- Format checks (email, date, UUID)
- Numeric ranges
- String length limits
- Custom regex patterns

### Body Validation

At the moment we perform presence validation and format in case is `application/json`


## Upcoming Features

We're actively working on expanding validation capabilities:

- OpenAPI/Swagger schema support
- XML payload validation
- GraphQL schema validation
- Advanced JSON Schema support
- Custom validation functions
- Schema versioning

## Current Limitations

Please note the following constraints:

- 1000 endpoint per OpenAPIv3 schema
- 2048 character path length limit
- 10MB maximum body size
- Basic JSON validation only (advanced features coming soon)
