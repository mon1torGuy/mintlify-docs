## Anomaly Detection

Advanced behavioral analysis system that detects unusual patterns in API usage. Helps identify potential security threats, API abuse, and system anomalies.

### Configuration

```typescript
{
    "anomalyDetection": {
      "enabled": true,
      "profile": "STANDARD", // PERMISSIVE, STANDARD, STRICT, API_GATEWAY, CUSTOM
      "customConfig": {} // Optional overrides
    }
  
}
```



### Available Profiles

1. **PERMISSIVE**
   - Best suited for: Public APIs, content delivery, and applications requiring minimal restrictions
   - Characteristics:
     - Most lenient monitoring approach
     - Focuses on logging and observation
     - Only flags extremely obvious anomalies
     - No blocking actions, only monitoring
   - Use case example: Content delivery networks, public documentation APIs

2. **STANDARD**
   - Best suited for: General web applications and business APIs
   - Characteristics:
     - Balanced approach between security and accessibility
     - Moderate alerting thresholds
     - Progressive response system (monitor → alert → challenge)
     - Comprehensive pattern monitoring
   - Use case example: SaaS platforms, e-commerce APIs

3. **STRICT**
   - Best suited for: Financial services, healthcare, and security-critical applications
   - Characteristics:
     - Zero-tolerance approach to suspicious behavior
     - Immediate action on detected anomalies
     - Comprehensive monitoring with strict thresholds
     - Prioritizes security over convenience
   - Use case example: Banking APIs, healthcare data systems

4. **API_GATEWAY**
   - Best suited for: High-traffic API gateways and microservices
   - Characteristics:
     - Optimized for high-frequency API calls
     - Pattern-specific actions based on severity
     - Short-term window analysis for quick response
     - Balanced between performance and security
   - Use case example: API gateways, microservices architectures

5. **CUSTOM**
   - Best suited for: Organizations with unique security requirements
   - Characteristics:
     - Complete control over all security parameters
     - Ability to create specialized detection rules
     - Flexible response system
     - Pattern-specific configurations
   - Use case example: Enterprise applications with specific compliance requirements

### Selection Guidelines

- Choose **PERMISSIVE** when:
  - You're starting with anomaly detection
  - You need to establish baseline behaviors
  - Your application serves public, non-sensitive content
  - You want to minimize user friction

- Choose **STANDARD** when:
  - You need balanced security
  - You have a mix of public and private APIs
  - You want automated responses without being too restrictive
  - You're unsure which profile to start with

- Choose **STRICT** when:
  - You handle sensitive data
  - Security is your top priority
  - You have regulatory compliance requirements
  - You need comprehensive audit trails

- Choose **API_GATEWAY** when:
  - You manage multiple backend services
  - You have high-frequency API calls
  - You need real-time anomaly detection
  - Performance is critical

- Choose **CUSTOM** when:
  - Standard profiles don't meet your needs
  - You have specific security requirements
  - You need different rules for different endpoints
  - You have unique compliance requirements

### Profile Migration Path

Recommended progression for new implementations:
1. Start with **PERMISSIVE** to gather baseline data
2. Move to **STANDARD** once normal patterns are established
3. Upgrade to **STRICT** or **API_GATEWAY** based on needs
4. Implement **CUSTOM** if specific adjustments are required


### Monitored Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Default Action |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Request Volume | Unusual number of requests | Alert |
| Error Rates | Abnormal error frequency | Block |
| Response Times | Unusual processing times | Alert |
| Payload Sizes | Abnormal request/response sizes | Alert |
| Endpoint Velocity | Unusual access patterns | Alert |

### Actions

- `monitor`: Log anomaly for analysis
- `alert`: Log and notify administrators
- `block`: Prevent request processing
- `challenge`: Require additional verification

### Example Response

```json
{
  "error": "Anomaly detected",
  "details": "Request volume anomaly detected: 150 requests/min (4.5σ deviation)",
  "riskScore": 75,
  "factors": [
    "Volume anomaly_5m",
    "Endpoint velocity_15m"
  ]
}
```

### Performance Impact

- Average latency impact: 1-5ms
- Configurable sampling rates
- Efficient caching of baseline metrics
- Async processing of non-critical operations

### Best Practices

1. Start with PERMISSIVE profile and monitor logs
2. Adjust to STANDARD once baseline is established
3. Use STRICT for high-security applications
4. Configure custom rules based on your traffic patterns
5. Monitor false positive rates and adjust accordingly

### Integration

```typescript
// TypeAuth configu
