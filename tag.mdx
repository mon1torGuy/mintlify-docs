## Creating Tags

Tags can be created and managed through two interfaces:

### Dashboard

The TypeAuth dashboard provides an intuitive interface for tag management:

1. Navigate to the Tags section
2. Click "Create New Tag"
3. Enter your tag name
4. Save your changes

### API

Create tags programmatically using the Tags API endpoint:

```http
POST /tags
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "thisismytag",
}
```

## Tagging Resources

### Applications

Tag your applications to organize them by:
- Environment (production, staging, development)
- Business unit
- Customer segment
- Geographic region

```http
POST /api/v1/applications/{application_id}/tags
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tags": [
    {"key": "environment", "value": "production"},
    {"key": "customer_tier", "value": "enterprise"}
  ]
}
```

### API Keys

Add tags to your API keys to:
- Track feature-specific usage
- Monitor integrations
- Analyze customer behavior

```http
POST /api/v1/keys/{key_id}/tags
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tags": [
    {"key": "feature", "value": "auth"},
    {"key": "region", "value": "eu-west"}
  ]
}
```

## Filtering

Filter your resources using tag-based queries:

```http
GET /api/v1/applications?tags[environment]=production
GET /api/v1/keys?tags[customer_tier]=enterprise
```

## Usage Analysis

Tags enable powerful usage analysis capabilities:

- **Customer Segmentation**: Track API usage across different customer segments
- **Feature Adoption**: Monitor which features are being used most frequently
- **Environment Analysis**: Compare usage patterns across different environments
- **Billing Support**: Generate accurate usage-based billing reports
- **Custom Reporting**: Create filtered reports based on specific tags

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use standardized naming conventions for your tags
2. **Descriptive Keys**: Keep tag keys short but meaningful
3. **Tag Limits**: Maintain a manageable number of unique tags
4. **Documentation**: Keep your team aligned by documenting your tagging strategy
5. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically audit and clean up unused tags

## Sample Tag Structure

Here are some common tag structures:

| Resource Type | Tag Key | Example Values |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| Application  | environment | production, staging, development |
| Application  | customer_tier | enterprise, pro, starter |
| API Key      | feature | auth, admin, analytics |
| API Key      | region | us-east, eu-west, asia-pacific |

## Tag Constraints

- Name must be between 3 and 50 characters
- Maximum of 5 tags per resource
- Names can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores
